    "Poker has always shown itself to be a challenging way to test one's luck and grit against odds that are exceptionally low. There are many different variants that slightly alter the odds. The poker variant 5 card draw has 2,598,960 different hand combinations in a standard 52 card deck. With this many possible hands it is easy to see how difficult it could be to get even a decent hand in a single 5 card draw. The reason that these odds do not hinder most players is that even a terrible hand has a chance to win with a good bluff. Great human poker players have learned when to bluff and how to tell when another player is bluffing. In order to compete, computerized robot players must focus on a categorical approach based on the odds and significant training. The overall aim of our project is to discover which techniques and neural networks performed the best at classifying poker hands.\n",
