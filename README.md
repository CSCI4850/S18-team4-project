This project uses Feed Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Poker Hands. We are using Poker Hand Data Set obtained from UCL Machine Learning Repository. A detailed walkthrough of the project can be found in the demo/demo.pdf.

## DEMO:

## Dependences:

1. [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) - Environment

2. [Treys Package](https://github.com/ihendley/treys/tree/master/treys) - This will be used to handle our deck of cards.

3. Make a local copy of this repo.
    $ git clone git@github.com:CSCI4850/S18-team4-project.git

4. Open the file demo.ipynb located in the demo folder and follow it to learn about our project.
